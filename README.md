### about me <br>

I'm a Machine Learning Researcher at Eigen Technologies (now the London office of Sirion). Previously, I was a Research Fellow in the O'Keefe Lab (Sainsbury Wellcome Centre). I completed my PhD in the Bizley Lab (UCL Ear Institute), where I TA-ed for Web Development and Software Engineering within the UCL CS Department. My research interests are changing as I transition into an industry researcher role; I'm most interested in generalisation in all of its forms, and that looks like right now developing adaptable, robust LLMs to summarise large bodies of text. This profile contains my public work and work from my PhD/postdoc.

In my PhD/post-doc I studied: <br>
1. applying machine learning techniques to solve neuroscience problems and improve artificial neural networks (esp. w.r.t. spatial navigation and sensory perception)
2. developing software for neuroscience research, particularly for spike sorting and classification ðŸ§  ðŸ“Š
