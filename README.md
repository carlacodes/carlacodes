### about me <br>

I'm a Research Fellow in the O'Keefe Lab (SWC), previously I was a PhD student in the Bizley Lab (UCL Ear Institute), where I TA-ed for Web Development and Software Engineering within the UCL CS Department. I'm most interested in: <br>
1. applying machine learning techniques to solve neuroscience problems (esp. w.r.t. spatial navigation and sensory perception)
2. developing software for neuroscience research, particularly for spike sorting and classification ðŸ§
